## Single Solver Delegation

MemSwap allows for single solver delegation, a mechanic that lets a single reputable solver provide the best route to a user and submit the bundle to trusted builders privately.

Single solver delegation works like this:

- Users or applications opt into to private order distribution
- Orders are routed directly to a trusted solver (mediated by a matchmaker)
- This solver can privately submits the transaction bundle to a builder using trusted private channels like private RPCs.

Private orders of this nature rely on trusted relationships with solvers, but while is seems like more trust is needed, in many ways true privacy requires less trust. When signal orders are submitted to permissioned or public pools (in fact any “pool” with more than one solver), it is challenging to attribute front-running. Identifying that some amount of MEV has occurred once the block has landed isn’t the hard part, it’s deciding who is responsible. Since any solver could have been the one to leak information, it is impossible to remove privileges from offending solvers. True privacy, as in, directing orders to a single solver makes attribution simple and incentivizing solvers to cooperate.
