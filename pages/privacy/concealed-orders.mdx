## Concealed Orders

Concealed orders follow a similar mechanic to [“programmable privacy” in MEV-share.](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/mev-share-programmably-private-orderflow-to-share-mev-with-users/1264) In order to limit signal leakage, key aspects of the order are concealed so the information cannot be used out of band. In particular, users might wish to hide the maker address and the quantity of tokens to be swapped.

How it works:

- Users or applications opt into to concealed orders
- Orders are routed to matchmakers who reveal hints to solvers
- Solvers use the hints to propose viable solutions
- Matchmakers choose the best solutions and construct tx bundles
- Matchmakers submit tx bundles to builders

This type of programmable privacy can prevent signal leakage, so it is advantageous when there are high signal trades. However, when trades are not high signal, privacy of this sort can be limiting, since hiding information can prevent solvers from constructing the best possible orders, and as a result may limit user upside.
