# Integrating Memswap into your App

MemSwap is designed with integrating applications in mind. You can read more about the technical process of integrating MemSwap by checking out our [App Integration Guide](/originators/originator-integration-guide).

For Originators, there are some key features for originators worth revisiting:

**Originator Fees**

MemSwap is designed to give originators (swapping applications) the best possible options to capture fees, including flat percentage fees or a percentage of surplus.

Learn more about [Orginator Fees](/protocol-features/originator-fees).

**MemSwap Swap Mode Selection**

MemSwap requires that originators choose the appropriate swap mode for their users, or provide users with the flexibility to chose themselves.

- Optimized - Leverages third party Matchmaker OFAs to get users the best price in the shortest amount of time
- Trustless - Fully decentralized market orders
- Private - Protect high-signal trades using private orders or programmable privacy

**Originator-hosted Matchmakers**

Originators may wish to host their own matchmaker rather than rely on a trusted third party. To do so, please check out our doc on [Running a Matchmaker](/matchmakers/running-a-matchmaker).
