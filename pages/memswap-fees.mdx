###Protocol Fees

MemSwap has no base protocol fee in beta. The protocol is designed so a fee may be taken in the future, but at the current time no protocol fees exist

### Application Fees

MemSwap is design to make it as easy as possible for integrating applications to take fees. In its current form applications may take fixed fees or a percentage of MEV surplus when a matchmaker is used. Building mechanics for applications to capture value is pertinent to avoiding centralizing PFOF models, as discussed here.
