## A brief introduction to MemSwap

MemSwap is a new “intents-based” swap protocol that leverages dutch auctions and propagates intents using the ethereum mempool, through a method called intentful transactions. The core protocol can be used as a fully decentralized swap aggregator. On top of the core, MemSwap introduces open-source and opt-in matchmakers that improve price execution, without relying on any individual central actor. The canonical MemSwap matchmaker provides better price execution by enabling an open market for searchers to fill one or many (partial) intents.
