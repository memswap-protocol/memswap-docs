# Solvers

MemSwap orders are submitted as approval transactions with appended intents in the calldata. These intents can be executed by actors that parse the intents from the calldata, so long as the conditions of the intent can be met. Actors that bundle intents and submit them are called **solvers**.

To execute MemSwap intents (i.e orders), solvers must parse intents from approval transactions and submit them to builders or an assigned matchmaker depending on the requirement of the intent. The parsing of intents can be done by listening to all approval transactions and checking if there's any additional data at the end of the calldata. That additional data should be parsed according to the expected intent format and then validated. Filling intents is done by bundling together the approval transaction and the execution transaction.
