## **MemSwap - A decentralized swap protocol**

MemSwap is a decentralized market order protocol that provides best-in-class price execution for a variety of different trading conditions. The core of leverages the Ethereum Mempool for order distribution and introduces an open and permissionless matchmakers that conduct order flow auctions (OFAs). The result is best-in-class price execution while maintaining an open and decentralized design.

The protocol has three major modes:

- **Decentralized** - The MemSwap Core is a fully decentralized and permissionless (implicit) OFA that leverages dutch auctions and the ethereum mempool for order distribution. It uses a novel order distribution mechanic called intentful transactions, and benefits from the widest solver network possible.

- **Best Execution** - Users and applications may opt in to using a permissionless network of Matchmakers - trusted third parties that conducts OFAs for improved price execution. Applications may run their own matchmakers or choose to work with reputable third parties.

- **Private** - High signal trades may be routed to solvers directly. Solvers the submit bundles using trusted private channels to ensure trades land onchain before leaking signal.

MemSwap is designed to give swappers the ability to choose the appropriate conditions of their trade to get the best execution possible. Depending on the type of trade (and user), a user may value price, speed, or privacy differently. MemSwap provides a solution for each of these circumstances, while minimizing centralization vectors.

In order to describe how each mode works, and how each mode overcomes some of the major problems described here, we start by introducing the core decentralized market order mechanic, the MemSwap core. And follow by introducing Matchmakers, and Private Order Flow.
