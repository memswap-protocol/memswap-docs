Why do we need matchmakers

While a dutch auction is great at minimizing MEV, it isn’t perfect. It can only set the price per block, which means the price decreases as a step function. If the market price is above the auction price, solvers will capture this surplus for themselves. If multiple solvers are competing, then a second “intra-block” auction takes place as they bribe the validator to get their bundle included. A lot can happen over the course of a block, and by default the user won’t benefit from it.

What’s the solution? For users and applications that want to exclusively rely on decentralized protocols, this value loss cannot be avoided, but changing the auction parameters can lead to improved execution prices.

For users looking for the best possible prices, MemSwap enables and alternative - shift the monopoly of choosing which bundle is included to someone with the users’ best interests in mind. We call this actor a Forwarder. The forwarder may be a trusted third party, or run by the swapping application itself. Forwarders allow for better price execution, including up to block confirmation improvements in price that occur due to interblock movement. While a trusted actor is necessary today, in the future the forwarding role may be decentralized.

One interesting notion of MemSwap is that many forwarders can exist. One important benefit of this is that

## What is a matchmaker

This is a reference implementation of a matchmaker, which is responsible for incentivizing solvers to offer better prices for their intent solutions. To be elligible for the benefits the matchmaker offers, a user or app should restrict the filler of their intents to the matchmaker's address. Using the built-in authorization mechanism of Memswap, the matchmaker will then only authorize for filling the solver(s) which offer(s) the best price to the user. The reference implementation uses the signature authorization mechanism as follows:

instead of submitting the solutions on-chain (as it's done for open or private intents), solvers of matchmaker-restricted intents can submit solutions directly to the matchmaker (which has a public API)
for every intent that is being filled, the matchmaker will run a 2-step auction: the first part of the auction will be won by the best-priced solution and in turn sets the starting price of the second step of the auction where any submission that offers at least the price of the previous step's winning solution is considered "successful"
the matchmaker will only release authorization signatures in the second part of the auction for "successful" solutions
since multiple signatures can be released by the matchmaker for any single intent, the solvers should do their best to have their solutions included in a block as soon as possible
to protect against "griefing" (eg. a solver providing a best-priced solution only to eliminate competition, but then not going through with the solution), the matchmaker requires all solvers to submit a signed transaction to the matchmaker (which in theory the matchmaker could always submit on-chain, thus forcing the solver to go through with their solution) (this is not bulletproof but it disincentivizes this behaviour)
