## Order Flow Auctions

Memswap uses Order Flow Auctions (OFAs) to help users capture value from their swap intents. The protocol is designed to enable a variety of OFA designs. At its core, the protocol is designed to facilitate an [protocol-mediate OFA](/order-flow-auctions/protocol-auction), by leveraging a fee escalator (dutch auction). This allows users to capture value as solvers compete to fill orders at the minimum auction price in any block. This design introduces a trade off between execution time and price.

To capture surplus, Memswap introduces [Matchmakers](/order-flow-auctions/matchmaker-auctions), trusted third parties that conduct OFAs on behalf of users directly or facilitate builder-conducted OFAs. Matchmakers are opt-in and open, so applications can choose to work with a reputable third party or run their own matchmaker.
