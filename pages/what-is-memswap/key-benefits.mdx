The key benefits of MemSwap are:

Permissionless order distribution: The protocol uses the ethereum mempool for propagation of swap intents, meaning no permissioned or opaque orderbook is required.

Eth, ERC-20, and ERC-721 compatibility: Due to the structure intentful transactions, MemSwap works with Eth pairs, as well as all ERC-20s and NFTs, without unlimited approvals.

No unlimited approvals: Unlimited approvals are a known security risk for users. Memswaps design avoids the need for these approvals.

Continuous price improvements: There is no need for exclusive filling rights based on off-chain auctions, so interblock price changes can be leveraged to improve swap prices.

DoS resistance: MemSwap eliminates the DoS attack vector, a common concern for intents in open, permissionless mempools.

No required centralized APIs: Centralized APIs present a censorship risk for developers, where affordances for centralized APIs improve UX, decentralized alternatives are important backstops.

No private RFQ: Private RFQ requires trusted actors to fill proposed routes. Where centralization leads to improved UX, users may layer centralized or private solutions atop MemSwap, while remaining confident in a decentralized core.

A fully decentralized alternative: The MemSwap core can be used without forwarders as a fully decentralized swap aggregator.

Improved price execution: MemSwap improves price execution for swappers through competition to provide the optimal route and internalize MEV.

Open and flexible forwarding: Applications and users can opt into forwarding for improved price execution if desired. Forwarders can be run openly, even by applications themselves.

An open market for solving: An open solving market enables all types of searchers to participate, improving price execution and democrazing the solving landscape
