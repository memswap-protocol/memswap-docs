## Permit/Gasless Swaps

Memswap supports gasless swaps via signed permit messages.

**Built-In Permit**

Tokens such as USDC with built-in permit can be swapped without any onchain approval.

**Permit2**

All other tokens can be gaslessly swapped using Permit2, after a one-time approval. This approval is shared with Uniswap and any other protocol using Permit2.
