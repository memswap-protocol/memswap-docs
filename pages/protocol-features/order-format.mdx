## Onchain Orderbook

While not a hard requirement, Memswap is designed to work well with a fully onchain orderbook that uses the Ethereum mempool for intent distribution, instead of an offchain API.

The Memswap order format was designed to support and efficient order format for onchain distribution in order to minimize gas while posting orders.

```ts
Intent = {
  isBuy,
  buyToken,
  sellToken,
  maker,
  solver,
  source,
  feeBps,
  surplusBps,
  startTime,
  endTime,
  isPartiallyFillable,
  isSmartOrder,
  isIncentivized,
  amount,
  endAmount,
  startAmountBps,
  expectedAmountBps,
  signature,
};
```
