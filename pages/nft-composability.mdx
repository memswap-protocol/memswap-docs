## NFT Composability

Intents provide a significant opportunity to improve retail trading UX above and beyond price improvements. Here we describe some of the exciting improvements that are enabled by MemSwap:

- **Minimize failed transactions** - orders may be filled by many routes over many blocks improving success rates
- **Fast tx propagation** - MemSwap allows orders filled (with approval) in a single block. Futhermore, matchmakers can leverage direct lines to solvers and builder increasing transaction propagation rates.
- **Buy with any currency** - Being able to purchase NFTs in any currency is an important UX improvement for users. While this is possible in some circumstances today, intents make is easier to buy NFTs in any currency and get a good rate when doing so.
- **Crosschain purchasing** - MemSwap can be extented to allow for cross-chain purchasing both for ERC-20s and NFTs.
- **Fee normalization** - For NFTs, normalizing fees, and in particular royalties, is important for many users. MemSwap enables fee normalization for all protocols, not just compliant ones.
- **Improved NFT minting dynamics** - Intents may be used to capture more value for creators and marketplaces during hotly contested NFT mints.
- **Buying NFTs with slippage** - During time of high volume, NFT purchasing can have high failure rates due to the individual nature of the tokens. MemSwap enables NFT users to buy with slippage, increasing their success rate in the case of high volumes.
- **Gas sponsorship** - Gas costs (which are internalized by solvers) may be sponsored with intents.
- **NFT CoWS** - There are a variety of NFT market Coincidence of Wants (CoWs) that are enabled by MemSwap, including ring trades, complex swapping, and more.
- **Originator fees** - MemSwap is designed to give originators (swapping applications) the best possible options to capture fees, including flat percentage fees or a percentage of surplus.
