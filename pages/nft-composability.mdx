## NFT Composability

The NFT market has evolved to feature _Aggregators_ that unlock a number of different advanced trading features:

- **Cross-Marketplace Sweeping** - Buy the cheapest items in a collection, no matter which marketplace they are listed on
- **Purchase Currency** - Buy NFTs with any currency, not just what they are listed in
- **Slippage Tolerance** - Avoid failed transactions by getting the next best listing if cheapest no longer available
- **Gasless** - Trade without ETH for gas, using ERC20 tokens or sponsorship
- **Royalty Normalization** - Add royalties to orders that didn't respect creator configuration
- **Taker Fees** - Allow apps to collect fees on top for driving trading

Today, all of these features require the use of a "router" contract, that adds functionality on top of the base marketplace contracts. This works works fine when liquidity is open and permissionless, but increasingly NFT liquidity comes with restrictions that threaten composability:

- Marketplaces like Blur that prevent all smart contracts from interacting
- NFT standards like ERC-721C that limit which only allow whitelisted marketplace protocols to interact

Memswap is able to retain composability, even with these restrictions, by using bundles of txs (sent from a solver's EOA) instead of router smart contracts. Memswap is able to validate that the conditions of a swap are satisfied, without actually performing the swap itself, or requiring that it happens in a single atomic transaction. For example, let’s say I want to use USDC to buy a restricted NFT listed in ETH. This can be solved across multiple txs:

1. Buy the NFT with ETH (paying full royalties)
2. Deliver NFT to user
3. Prove order has been satisified, in order to pull users’ USDC and swap it back into ETH

While this increases the complexity, the burden mostly falls on professional solvers, and can be abstracted entirely from end-users.
