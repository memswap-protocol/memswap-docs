## A brief introduction to MemSwap

MemSwap is a decentralized swap protocol that provides best-in-class price execution, while minimizing centralization vectors. To acheive this the protocol delivers three key innovations:

- **The MemSwap Core Protocol** - a fully decentralized and permissionless swap protocol
- **Matchmakers** - a network of trusted third parties who act in the best interest of swappers to improve price execution
- **Private Swaps** - direct, private lines to solvers for improved execution for high signal trades

The MemSwap Core propagates intents using the ethereum mempool, through a method called [intentful transactions](/intentfultransactions).
The core protocol can be used as a _fully decentralized_ swap aggregator. On top of the core, MemSwap introduces open-source and opt-in [matchmakers](/matchmakers) that improve price execution, without relying on any individual central actor. The canonical MemSwap matchmaker provides better price execution by enabling an open market for solvers to fill one or many (partial) intents. For high signal trades, swappers may opt for direct, private lines with single solvers.
