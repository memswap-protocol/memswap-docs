# MemBook (Intentful Transactions)

MemSwap is built atop MemBook, a protocol that formalizes intentful transactions.

## What is an intentful transaction?

An intentful transaction is a transaction that embeds a user's intent. Practically, a user, expecting an intent to be fulfilled, may embed the conditions of their intent inside a transactionâ€™s calldata.

Imagine that a user has the following intent:

EXAMPLE INTENT

This intent can be hashed and appended to any transactions calldata. We hash the intent as follows:

EXAMPLE hash

and append the hash to the transactions call data. You can see an example append here:

[example transaction](https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0x3214273fa15ce600057299dfc02e881c2896bce1f7005480dd2b4aa2d9d47b15) - This approval transaction calls the depositAndApprove method, with the intent appended in the calldata.

## How does MemSwap leverage intentful transactions?

In the case of MemSwap, intents are embedded into approval transactions for the tokens required in the swap (or transfers for Eth swaps).

Solvers may then parse intents from the ethereum mempool and submit bundles to block builders or matchmakers once they can fulfill the conditions of the intent. We describe the specifics of intentful transactions in MemSwap, this mechanism could be used for a variety of intent types.

### MemSwap Orders

Swap intents in memswap are dutch auctions, similar to uniswapX and conform to the EIP-712 order standard. An example swap intent in MemSwap may be as follows:
