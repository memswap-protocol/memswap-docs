## Matchmaker V1

The current V1 matchmaker for Memswap is hosted by Reservoir (reservoir-matchmaker.eth). The matchmaker has two modes - a _public last block auction_ and _single solver submission._

##### Last Block Public Auction

The matchmaker conducts a Last Block Auction in order to improve price execution for any orders that nominate it. You can learn more about the matchmaker auction [here](/order-flow-auctions/matchmaker-auction). Here we describe the implementation details of the V1 Matchmaker:

- The matchmaker is nominated by users or applications who set the matchmaker as the exclusive authorizer in the order.
- Applications submit orders to the Mempool using intentful transactions. Solvers listen to the Mempool for order discovery.
- For the first 9 seconds of the block, the matchmaker accepts solutions to usersâ€™ intents, and simulates orders against the last block
  - Solutions must solve a single route (no order COWs)
- The matchmaker conducts an order flow auction, accepting any orders that are within a fixed percentage of the top bid
- Matchmaker releases signatures to solvers authorizing submission
- Solvers respond with a signed transaction, signaling intent to submit
- Solvers are then free to submit bundles to builders

##### Single Solver Submission

For users wanting privacy, the V1 matchmaker allows users to submit intents privately to a single solver.

- Users submit private orders directly to the matchmaker
- The matchmaker nominates a single solver and submits the order to a trusted solver directly
- The solver submits the bundle to builders using known privacy channels such as private RPCs
