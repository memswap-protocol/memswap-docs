## Matchmaker V1

The current V1 matchmaker for MemSwap is hosted by Reservoir (reservoir-matchmaker.eth). The matchmaker has two modes - a _public last block auction_ and _single solver submission._

##### Last Block Public Auction

The matchmaker conducts a Last Block Auction in order to improve price execution for any orders that nominate it. Here we describe the implementation details of this matchmaker.

- The matchmaker is nominated by users or applications who set the matchmaker as the exclusive authorizer in the order.
- Applications submit orders to the Mempool using intentful transactions. Solvers listen to the Mempool for order discovery.
- For the first 9 seconds of the block, the matchmaker accepts solutions to usersâ€™ intents, and simulates orders against the last block
  - Solutions must solve a single route (no order COWs)
- Matchmaker conducts an order flow auction, accepting any orders that are within a fixed percentage of the top bid
- Matchmaker releases signatures to solvers authorizing submission
- Solvers must respond with a signed transaction
- Solvers are then free to submit bundles builders

##### Single Solver Submission

For users wanting privacy, the V1 matchmaker allows users to submit intents privately to a single solver.

- Users submit private orders directly to the matchmaker
- The matchmaker nominates a single solver and submits the order to a trusted solver directly
- The solver submits the bundle to builders using known privacy channels such as private RPCs

##### Order Propagation

- You can send orders to it for faster distribution to solvers
